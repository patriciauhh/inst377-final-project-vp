Music platforms such as Spotify arenâ€™t able to create personalized playlists that their users enjoy. Majority of its users create their own playlists, this makes it harder for them to find new music and help smaller   artists build their career. Some of Spotify's daily mixes are repetitive and biased when it comes to lesser-known artists. Users heavily rely on different platforms like TikTok to find new music, artists also rely on   this platform to get their music noticed. We want to create a platform that avoids these issues so that there is a better user experience for customers and artists. 

Some of the stakeholders would be students ranging from middle to college level, artists, music labels, and music publishers. Ideally, this website is catered towards desktop users since the resolution of it isn't designed for it. Both IOS and Windows users are able to use the website. 
 

Our system would help users find new music, usually people get bored of their playlist because it gets repetitive. Broadening the algorithm also allows aspiring artists to get popularity since the system would be adding try to create personalized playlists for users to discover new artists.
